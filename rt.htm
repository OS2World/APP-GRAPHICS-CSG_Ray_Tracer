<H1>CSG Ray Tracer, original version</H1>

<!--...sIntroduction:0:-->
<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>This ray-tracer based on information given in "Computer Graphics, Principles
and Practice", by Foley, vanDam, Feiner and Hughes, and Byte magazine.

<P>A
<A HREF="rtfiles.htm">document</A> is available describing the script language.

<!--...sCompilers etc\46\:0:-->
<H2>Compilers etc.</H2>

<P>I've compiled RT with the IBM xlc compiler under AIX,
gcc 2.7.2.3 under Linux 2.0.30,
and it should compile fine with any general ANSI UNIX compiler.

<P>I've also used the IBM VisualAge C/C++ 3.0 compiler for OS/2,
with CTC306, CTD302 and CTU304 fixes.

<P>I've used MSVC 5.0 under Windows NT 4.0 and it works too.

<P>The UNIX <CODE>makefile</CODE> relys on GNU <CODE>make</CODE>.
If you haven't got this, you can use the <CODE>mpp</CODE> script on my
home page to pre-process the <CODE>ifdef</CODE>s and produce a file
suitable for your platform.

<H2>Public domain declaration</H2>

<P>I wrote all this code in my own time on my own equiptment.
I hereby place all this code into the public domain.
Feel free to do whatever you like with it.
No copyright / no royalties / no guarantees / no problem.
Caveat Emptor.

<!--...sSource code:0:-->
<H2>Source code</H2>

<P>All the source code is folded using Andys Source Code Folding Editor, which
should be available from the same place you obtained this package.
The source is all highly portable.

<P>The full source to GBM is hopefully available from the same place you
obtained this Ray Tracer.
By obtaining the source, versions of GBM for AIX and other 32
bit operating systems may be easily be built.
GBM is also highly portable.

<H2>Obtaining this code</H2>

<P>This raytracer, the GBM executables, the GBM source, and Andys Source
Code Folding Editor are best obtained via my home page :-

<P>To run under OS/2, you don't need the GBM source, but you will need
GBM itself.
Under UNIX, you'll need the source and will compile it and RT.
If you wish to edit/browse/appreciate the source, you'd benefit from AE.

<!--...sThe future\44\ the Modular Renderer:0:-->
<H2>The future, the Modular Renderer</H2>

<P>This program will no longer be supported in the future.
It has been replaced by the "Modular Renderer".
This is a library of C++ classes and functions which provide a superset of
the RT functionality.

<P>This means that now the full C++ language can be at your disposal to help
build models for tracing and also for automating the generation of animations.
It also opens the door to procedural textures and other advanced features.

<P>Furthermore, MR provides other forms of rendering, such as wire-frame
and polygon rendering, in order to provide fast previews etc..

<P>It has the disadvantage that in order to perform raytracing, you have to
write a program and compile it.
Accordingly MR has a raytracer called RTMR, which is backwardly compatible
with RT and implemented using MR.
